        <p>The first recors of the word cohort come from the late 1400's. It comes from the Latin word cohors, meaning yard
            "farmyard," or "company" of Soldiers" (in reference to a place where Soldiers camped). ... The word cohort was origanlly
            used to refer to ancient Roman military units consisting of 300 to 600 Soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>Today the use of the word "Cohorts" bears same. Today Cohorts represent like minded individuals, usually of similar
            age, experience, and the building of a support system; that's what we're doing here a DigitalCrafts. Yes we're
            learning Web Development, but also developing relationships with our Cohorts that can last a lifetime.
